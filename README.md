# **Online Marketplace**

This is an online marketplace I'm doing in honor to _[100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/)_ challenge.

This project consists in an online marketplace using MERN fullstack tools (MongoDB, Express, React - Next.js, Node.js). Altough I can make everything in Next.js and MongoDB, I want to still use Node.js and Express to exercise my REST api practices.

## Technologies Used

The tecnologies used are the following:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Design

The design, in that particular phase, is not made by me, but is ispired by the great designer [Md Rimel](https://dribbble.com/mdrimel15).
